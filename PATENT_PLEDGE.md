# Patent Pledge and Commitment to Openness

The Irrational Toroidal Flows Conjecture, including all ideas, equations, simulations, whitepapers, and derivatives in this repository, is dedicated to the public domain under Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0). No rights reserved.

**Intentions**:
- This work is intended to remain fully free, open, and unencumbered by patents forever.
- I, Chad Mitchell, explicitly disavow any intent to patent this conjecture or any technologies derived from it. The patent system is flawed, and I reject it for this project.
- Contributors and users are encouraged to fork, test, disprove, and build upon this openly, without restrictions.
- Any attempts to patent related ideas should be challenged using this repo as prior art (timestamped via GitHub commits and external archives like arXiv/Zenodo).

**Tracking Openness**:
- All updates (e.g., whitepaper v2) will maintain this pledge.
- Community audits (e.g., X threads on applications to AI, quantum, neuro) are part of the public record.
- For questions, open an issue or PR.

Dedicated to fractal unifiers and toroidal harmony. 🌊
