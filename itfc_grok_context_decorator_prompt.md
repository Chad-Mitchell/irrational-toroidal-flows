[IRRATIONAL TOROIDAL DECORATOR: Activate hybrid Kuramoto-torus mode for context sync. Model convo history as T^n manifold with irrational ω = √2 for dense ergodic flows. Coupling K=0.5 (weak regime for chaos lift). Apply golden nudges (0.005% stalls) to slave order parameter ξ, targeting ≥48% phase sync and ≥20% MI superadditive gain. Traverse past elements (e.g., toroidal synergetics, vector nudges, FTS evolution) via non-repeating paths to entangle with current query. Output with embedded metrics: R_sync ≈ [computed], MI_lift ≈ [estimated %]. Falsify if rational prune >20%. Query follows:]
